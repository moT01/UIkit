# Releasing UIKit

This runbook covers the CDN release path for UIKit. npm publishing is separate
and still uses Changesets.

## What ships

The CDN bundle is built into `dist-cdn/uikit/` and then synced into
`freeCodeCamp/cdn/build/uikit/`.

The top-level bundle contains:

- `styles.min.css`
- `tokens.min.css`
- `components.min.css`
- `uikit.global.js`
- `sprite.svg`
- `fonts/`
- `brand/` when present
- `manifest.json`
- `latest/`
- `<major>/`
- `<major>.<minor>/`
- `<major>.<minor>.<patch>/`

Do not rearrange this tree when syncing to the CDN repo.

## Version aliases

The CDN build reads `packages/uikit/package.json` for the version.

For package version `1.2.3`, the build emits:

```text
uikit/styles.min.css
uikit/latest/styles.min.css
uikit/1/styles.min.css
uikit/1.2/styles.min.css
uikit/1.2.3/styles.min.css
```

Alias rules:

- root tracks the current release
- `latest/` tracks the current release
- `<major>/` tracks the latest release in that major line
- `<major>.<minor>/` tracks the latest release in that minor line
- `<major>.<minor>.<patch>/` is fully pinned

The GitHub release job requires a full `x.y.z` semver version before it opens
the CDN PR.

## Build and verify locally

Build all package outputs first:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Build only the CDN package path and its upstream dependency graph:

```bash
pnpm build:cdn
```

Verify the generated CDN tree:

```bash
pnpm verify:cdn
```

The package-level equivalents are:

```bash
pnpm --filter @freecodecamp/uikit-cdn build
pnpm --filter @freecodecamp/uikit-cdn verify
```

## CDN build internals

`packages/uikit-cdn/scripts/build.mjs`:

- bundles CSS with Lightning CSS
- creates:
  - `styles.min.css`
  - `tokens.min.css`
  - `components.min.css`
- rewrites font URLs from `/fonts/...` to `./fonts/...`
- copies fonts from `packages/uikit-css/src/fonts`
- copies brand assets from `packages/uikit-css/src/brand` when present
- copies `packages/uikit-js/dist/uikit.global.js`
- copies `packages/uikit-icons/dist/sprite.svg`
- writes `manifest.json`
- mirrors the bundle into `latest`, major, minor, and exact-version aliases

The manifest stores:

- `bytes`
- `sha256` as hex
- `sha384` as W3C-shaped integrity text, for example `sha384-<base64>`

## CDN verification internals

`packages/uikit-cdn/scripts/verify.mjs` checks:

- required files exist
- no minified CSS file contains absolute `/fonts/` URLs
- every `./fonts/...` CSS reference resolves to a real file
- every manifest sha256 and sha384 matches recomputed file hashes
- alias directories contain the same files as the top-level bundle
- alias files match top-level bundle hashes

Verification exits non-zero on the first failed run summary.

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on:

- pushes to `main`
- pull requests targeting `main`

It calls four reusable workflows:

- `re-lint.yml`
  - `pnpm format:check`
  - `pnpm typecheck`
- `re-test.yml`
  - `pnpm test:coverage`
  - uploads coverage artifacts from `packages/*/coverage` and
    `apps/*/coverage`
- `re-build.yml`
  - `pnpm build`
  - `pnpm --filter @freecodecamp/uikit-cdn run verify`
  - optionally uploads the `dist-cdn` artifact
- `re-visual.yml`
  - installs Playwright Chromium
  - `pnpm build`
  - `pnpm --filter @freecodecamp/uikit-docs test:visual`
  - uploads Playwright failure artifacts

The shared setup action installs pnpm 10, Node 22, and dependencies with
`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`.

## GitHub Actions release

`.github/workflows/release.yml` is manual and uses `workflow_dispatch`.

Input:

- `ref`: the UIkit git ref to release

Release job order:

1. `lint` runs the reusable lint workflow.
2. `test` runs the reusable test workflow.
3. `visual` runs after lint and test.
4. `build` runs after lint, test, and visual, then uploads `dist-cdn`.
5. `publish-cdn` runs after build and opens the CDN PR.

`publish-cdn` performs these steps:

1. Checks out this repo at the selected `ref` into `uikit/`.
2. Downloads the `dist-cdn` artifact into `uikit/dist-cdn/`.
3. Reads `packages/uikit/package.json` version.
4. Fails unless the version is full `x.y.z` semver.
5. Checks out `freeCodeCamp/cdn` into `cdn/` with `CDN_PUSH_TOKEN`.
6. Warns if `cdn/build/uikit/<version>/` already exists.
7. Runs `rsync -a --delete uikit/dist-cdn/uikit/ cdn/build/uikit/`.
8. Opens a PR on `freeCodeCamp/cdn`.
9. Writes a GitHub Actions summary with the ref, version, branch, and
   republish warning when relevant.

The PR branch is:

```text
release/uikit-v<version>
```

The PR title and commit message are:

```text
chore(uikit): publish v<version>
```

## Required secret

The release workflow needs `CDN_PUSH_TOKEN`.

That token must be able to:

- check out `freeCodeCamp/cdn`
- push the release branch
- open the publish PR

The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` is not used for cross-repo writes.

## npm publishing

The CDN release flow does not publish npm packages.

For package releases:

1. Add a changeset for package-visible changes:

   ```bash
   pnpm changeset
   ```

2. When ready, consume changesets on `main`:

   ```bash
   pnpm changeset version
   ```

3. Review package versions and generated changelogs.
4. Commit the version bump.
5. Publish with an org-scoped npm token:

   ```bash
   pnpm changeset publish
   ```

The root `pnpm release` script runs `turbo run build && changeset publish`.

## Quick CDN checklist

1. Confirm `packages/uikit/package.json` has the intended `x.y.z` version.
2. Run `pnpm build`.
3. Run `pnpm verify:cdn`.
4. Push or merge the release ref.
5. Dispatch `Release` with `ref` set to that ref.
6. Review the Actions summary.
7. Review and merge the generated PR in `freeCodeCamp/cdn`.
8. Confirm `freeCodeCamp/cdn/build/uikit/` contains root, `latest`, major,
   minor, and exact-version aliases.
