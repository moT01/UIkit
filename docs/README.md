# UIKit repo docs

Maintainer + contributor reference for this monorepo. The public product
documentation is the Astro docs site at
[`https://design.freecodecamp.org`](https://design.freecodecamp.org)
(source: [`apps/docs`](../apps/docs/README.md)).

## Source of truth

These docs describe the checked-out repo state. For exact behavior,
read the source files they point to:

- package scripts: root `package.json` and each workspace `package.json`
- task graph: `turbo.json`
- CI and release: `.github/workflows/*`
- component inventory: `apps/docs/src/data/nav.ts` and
  `apps/docs/src/data/knownComponents.ts`
- package exports: `packages/*/package.json` and package barrel files

If a command or workflow changes, update the relevant repo doc in the
same PR.
